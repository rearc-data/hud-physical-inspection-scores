The source code outlining how this product gathers, transforms, revises and publishes its datasets is available at [https://github.com/rearc-data/hud-physical-inspection-scores](https://github.com/rearc-data/hud-physical-inspection-scores).

## Main Overview
HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center conducts physical property inspections of properties that are owned, insured or subsidized by HUD, including public housing and multifamily assisted housing. About 20,000 such inspections are conducted each year to ensure that assisted families have housing that is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. The data provided with this resource offers a full historical view of the results of those inspections, providing point-in-time property scores. Separate datasets are available for public housing and for multifamily assisted properties. The dataset includes property identifiers and location information.
